My funny Valentine
Sweet, comic Valentine
You
Make me smile, ooh
With my heart

Your looks are laughable
Unphotographable
Yet, you're my favorite work of art

Is your figure less, is it less than Greek?
Is your mouth a little bit weak?
When you open it to speak, are you smart?

Don't, baby, don't
Change your hair for me
Not if you care for me

Stay, stay little Valentine, stay
Each day is Valentine's
Each day is Valentine's

Stay, little Valentine, stay
Each day is Valentine's
Each day is Valentine's Day

Valentine's
Day (day, day, day)

(This song is like my testimonial)
