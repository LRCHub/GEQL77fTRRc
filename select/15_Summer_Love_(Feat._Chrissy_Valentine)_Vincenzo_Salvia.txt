If you ever feel so lonely and alone
Pick up your phone and call me
The sun is so high in the sky today
Come with me and love me

I'm waiting for your call
My heart is beating so hard
You've got nothing to lose
I'll be your summer love
I'm waiting for your call
My heart is beating so hard
You've got nothing to lose
I'll be your summer love

A summer love in the sunshine
A summer love for you feel fine
A summer love 'till we got time
A summer love at the seaside

If you ever need to warm your heart
Lay on the sand and kiss me
The sun has set down in the sky just now
Come with me and love me

I got you but I want more
The sun is burning so hot
Your body is turning me on
I'll be your summer love
I got you but I want more
The sun is burning so hot
Your body is turning me on
I'll be your summer love
